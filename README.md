# dev-blog DYNAMIC
My second project. <br>
I turned my blog into a dynamic PHP web page.



NOTES FOR DEVELOPER: <br>
TO DO
- check css files for FLAG, CHESS TABLE, PERIODIC TABLE exercices. 
- add a hamburger menu

Questions
- In the footer I used "section" for links and copyright texts (p tags).
 Which tag should i use for this, as a container?
